## How to add a theme
### 1) Create your username
- Create a new file inside the folder `/authors/`.
- The filename is the username and the file extension is `.json`. Please use lowercase without spaces. For example, the username `Max Power` the filename is going to be `max-power.json`.
- You can copy a template from `/templates/author.json` to generate the content of the file.

### 2) Create the theme metadata
- Create a new folder with the name of the theme inside the folder `/items/`. Please use lowercase without spaces. For example, the theme name is `Hello World` the folder is going to be `/items/hello-world`.
- Create a file for the metadata inside the previous folder created, the filename needs to be `metadata.json`, you can copy a template from `/templates/item.json` to generate the content of the file.
- Create a screenshot of the theme and placed next to the file `metadata.json`, the filename needs to be `screenshot.png`, size recommended `800x600px`.

If your theme is free, the field `price_usd` needs to be `0` otherwise set the price, only the number without the coin type.
